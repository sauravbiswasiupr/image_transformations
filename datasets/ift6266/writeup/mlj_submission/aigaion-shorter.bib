We describe recent improvements to the parser, in particular stacked parsing, exploiting a beam search strategy and using a Multilayer Perceptron classifier. For the Evalita 2009 Dependency Parsing task DesR was configured to use a combination of stacked parsers. The stacked combination achieved the best accuracy scores in both the main and pilot subtasks. The contribution to the result of various choices is analyzed, in particular for taking advantage of the peculiar features of the TUT Treebank.}

in spectral clustering. We show that in all of these cases the learning algorithm
estimates the principal eigenfunctions of an operator that depends on
the unknown data density and on a kernel that is not necessarily positive
semi-definite. This helps to generalize some of these algorithms so as to predict
an embedding for out-of-sample examples without having to retrain the

the recent literature. They rely on the idea of building a graph whose nodes are
data points (labeled and unlabeled) and edges represent similarities between points.
Known labels are used to propagate information through the graph in order to label
all nodes. In this chapter, we show how these different algorithms can be cast into
a common framework where one minimizes a quadratic cost criterion whose closed-form solution is found by solving a linear system of size n (total number of data
points). The cost criterion naturally leads to an extension of such algorithms to
the inductive setting, where one obtains test samples one at a time: the derived
induction formula can be evaluated in O(n) time, which is much more efficient
than solving again exactly the linear system (which in general costs O(kn2) time
for a sparse graph where each data point has k neighbors). We also use this inductive
formula to show that when the similarity between points satisfies a locality property,
then the algorithms are plagued by the curse of dimensionality, with respect to the
dimensionality of an underlying manifold.},

are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), reasoning,
intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue
that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must
endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal
need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present
mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches
to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited
in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis
focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in
which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer
of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient
in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second,
we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the
curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning)
and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant
image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in
which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract
and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the
potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and
that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required

believe it involves the learning of highly varying functions, in a
mathematical sense. We bring forward two types of arguments which convey
the message that many currently popular machine learning approaches to
learning flexible functions have fundamental limitations that render them 
inappropriate for learning highly varying functions. The first issue
concerns the representation of such functions with what we call shallow model
architectures.  We discuss limitations of shallow architectures, such as
so-called kernel machines, boosting algorithms, and one-hidden-layer artificial neural
networks.  The second issue is more focused and concerns kernel machines
with a local kernel (the type used most often in practice),
that act like a collection of template matching units. We present
mathematical results on such computational architectures showing that they
have a limitation similar to those already proved for older non-parametric
methods, and connected to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Though it has long
been believed that efficient learning in deep architectures is difficult,

The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with {LLE}, Isomap, spectral clustering and {MDS} show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding.},

This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that dont take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.},

In this paper we present a methodology to select many hyper-parameters that is based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters. We first consider the case of a training criterion that is quadratic in the parameters. In that case, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters is efficiently computed by back-propagating through a Cholesky decomposition.

highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how
to train such deep networks, since gradient-based
optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck
in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced
a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief
Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal
variables. In the context of the above optimization problem,
we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to
better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are
continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not
revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task.
Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy
layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the
optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a
good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations
that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.}

  abstract = {A language model is a function, or an algorithm for learning such a function, that captures the salient statistical characteristics of the distribution of sequences of words in a natural language, typically allowing one to make probabilistic predictions of the next word given preceding ones.

A neural network language model is a language model based on Neural Networks , exploiting their ability to learn distributed representations to reduce the impact of the curse of dimensionality.

In the context of learning algorithms, the curse of dimensionality refers to the need for huge numbers of training examples when learning highly complex functions. When the number of input variables increases, the number of required examples can grow exponentially. The curse of dimensionality arises when a huge number of different combinations of values of the input variables must be discriminated from each other, and the learning algorithm needs at least one example per relevant combination of values. In the context of language models, the problem comes from the huge number of possible sequences of words, e.g., with a sequence of 10 words taken from a vocabulary of 100,000 there are 10^{50} possible sequences...

A distributed representation of a symbol is a tuple (or vector) of features which characterize the meaning of the symbol, and are not mutually exclusive. If a human were to choose the features of a word, he might pick grammatical features like gender or plurality, as well as semantic features like animate" or invisible. With a neural network language model, one relies on the learning algorithm to discover these features, and the features are continuous-valued (making the optimization problem involved in learning much simpler).

The basic idea is to learn to associate each word in the dictionary with a continuous-valued vector representation. Each word corresponds to a point in a feature space. One can imagine that each dimension of that space corresponds to a semantic or grammatical characteristic of words. The hope is that functionally similar words get to be closer to each other in that space, at least along some directions. A sequence of words can thus be transformed into a sequence of these learned feature vectors. The neural network learns to map that sequence of feature vectors to a prediction of interest, such as the probability distribution over the next word in the sequence. What pushes the learned word features to correspond to a form of semantic and grammatical similarity is that when two words are functionally similar, they can be replaced by one another in the same context, helping the neural network to compactly represent a function that makes good predictions on the training set, the set of word sequences used to train the model.

The advantage of this distributed representation approach is that it allows the model to generalize well to sequences that are not in the set of training word sequences, but that are similar in terms of their features, i.e., their distributed representation. Because neural networks tend to map nearby inputs to nearby outputs, the predictions corresponding to word sequences with similar features are mapped to similar predictions. Because many different combinations of feature values are possible, a very large set of possible meanings can be represented compactly, allowing a model with a comparatively small number of parameters to fit a large training set.}

We introduce a recurrent connectionist architecture having a modular structure that associates a subnetwork to each state. The model has a statistical interpretation we call Input/Output Hidden {Markov} Model ({IOHMM}). It can be trained by the {EM} or {GEM} algorithms, considering state trajectories as missing data, which decouples temporal credit assignment and actual parameter estimation.
The model presents similarities to hidden {Markov} models ({HMM}s), but allows us to map input sequences to output sequences, using the same processing style as recurrent neural networks. {IOHMM}s are trained using a more discriminant learning paradigm than {HMM}s, while potentially taking advantage of the {EM} algorithm.
We demonstrate that {IOHMM}s are well suited for solving grammatical inference problems on a benchmark problem. Experimental results are presented for the seven Tomita grammars, showing that these adaptive models can attain excellent generalization.},

The proposed method of automatically finding the learning rule relies on the idea of considering the synaptic modification rule as a parametric function. This function has local inputs and is the same in many neurons. The parameters that define this function can be estimated with known learning methods. For this optimization, we give particular attention to gradient descent and genetic algorithms. In both cases, estimation of this function consists of a joint global optimization of (a) the synaptic modification function, and (b) the networks that are learning to perform some tasks. The proposed methodology can be used as a tool to explore the missing pieces of the puzzle of neural networks learning. Both network architecture, and the learning function can be designed within constraints derived from biological knowledge.},

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

We address both issues with a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians in which some parameters are shared to reflect the similar signals observed in different states of the reactor. An {EM} algorithm for these shared Gaussian mixtures is presented. Experimental results on nuclear plant data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the above two points.},

To address this issue we propose to use recurrent networks with feedback into the input units, based on two fundamental ideas. The first motivation is that the filled-in value of the missing variable may not only depend in complicated ways on the value of this variable in the past of the sequence but also on the current and past values of other variables. The second motivation is that, for the purpose of making predictions or taking decisions, it is not always necessary to fill in the best possible value of the missing variables. In fact, it is sufficient to fill in a value which helps the system make better predictions or decisions. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated through experiments on several tasks.},

    is a crude predictor of neuron response in visual area V1.
    More descriptive models of V1 have been advanced that are no more computationally expensive,
    yet artificial neural network research continues to focus on networks of affine-sigmoidal models.
    This paper identifies two qualitative differences between the affine-sigmoidal hidden unit
    and a particular recent model of V1 response:
    a) the presence of a low-rank quadratic term in the argument to $\sigma$, 
    and b) the use of a gentler non-linearity than the $\tanh$ or logistic sigmoid.
    We evaluate these model ingredients by training single-layer 
    neural networks to solve three image classification tasks.
    We experimented with fully-connected hidden units,
    as well as locally-connected units and convolutional units
    that more closely mimic the function and connectivity of the visual system.
    On all three tasks, both the quadratic interactions and the gentler non-linearity
    lead to significantly better generalization.
    The advantage of quadratic units was strongest in conjunction with sparse and convolutional hidden units.}

This family is learned using training examples sampled from a group of related tasks. Learning models trained on these tasks are only allowed to select hypotheses that belong to the family.

  abstract = {The application of linear machine learning classiﬁers to the analysis of brain imaging data (fMRI) has led to several interesting breakthroughs in recent years. These classiﬁers combine the responses of the voxels to detect and categorize diﬀerent brain states. They allow a more agnostic analysis than conventional fMRI analysis that systematically treats weak and distributed patterns as unwanted noise. In this project, we use such classiﬁers to validate an hypothesis concerning the encoding of sounds in the human brain. More precisely, we attempt to locate neurons tuned to spectral and temporal modulations in sound. We use fMRI recordings of brain responses of subjects listening to 49 diﬀerent spectro-temporal modulations. The analysis of fMRI data through linear classiﬁers is not yet a standard procedure in this ﬁeld. Thus, an important objective of this project, in the long term, is the development of new machine learning algorithms specialized for neuroimaging data. For these reasons, an important part of the experiments is dedicated to studying the behaviour of the classiﬁers. We are mainly interested in 3 standard linear classiﬁers, namely the support vectors machine algorithm (linear), the logistic regression algorithm (regularized) and the na{\"{\i}}ve bayesian gaussian model (shared variances).}

This hybrid is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized {Pareto} tail.  We use this hybrid in a multi-modal mixture in order to obtain a nonparametric density estimator that can easily adapt for heavy tailed data. To obtain a conditional density estimator, the parameters of the mixture estimator can be seen as
functions of X and these functions learned. We show experimentally that this approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood than compared competing algorithms : conditional mixture models with other types of components and multivariate nonparametric models.},

A third parameter, in addition to the location and spread parameters of the Gaussian, controls the heaviness of the upper tail. Using the hybrid {Pareto} in a mixture model results in a nonparametric estimator that can adapt to multimodality, asymmetry, and heavy tails. A conditional density estimator is built by modeling the parameters of the mixture estimator as functions of X. We use a neural network to implement these functions. Such conditional density estimators have important applications in many domains such as finance and insurance. We show experimentally that this novel approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood, compared to competing algorithms: conditional mixture models with other types of components and a classical kernel-based nonparametric model.}

  abstract = {Density estimators that can adapt to asymmetric heavy tails are required in many applications such as finance and insurance. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has developped principled methods based on asymptotic results to estimate the tails of most distributions. However, the finite sample approximation might introduce a severe bias in many cases. Moreover, the full range of the distribution is often needed, not only the tail area. On the other hand, non-parametric methods, while being powerful where data are abundant, fail to extrapolate properly in the tail area. We put forward a non-parametric density estimator that brings together the strengths of non-parametric density estimation and of EVT.  A hybrid {Pareto} distribution that can be used in a mixture model is proposed to extend the generalized {Pareto} (GP) to the whole real axis. Experiments on simulated data show the following. On one hand, the mixture of hybrid {Pareto}s converges faster in terms of log-likelihood and provides good estimates of the tail of the distributions when compared with other density estimators including the GP distribution. On the other hand, the mixture of hybrid {Pareto}s offers an alternate way to estimate the tail index which is comparable to the one estimated with the standard GP methodology. The mixture of hybrids is also evaluated on the Danish fire insurance data set.}

  abstract = {We put forward a class of density estimators that can adapt to asymmetric, multi-modal and heavy-tailed distributions. Such distributions occur in many application domains such as finance and insurance. Mixture of gaussians are flexible non-parametric density estimators that have good approximation properties when the number of components is well chosen with respect to the training set size. However, those models are performing poorly on heavy-tailed data because few observations occur in the tail area. To solve this problem, we resort to extreme value theory where methods based on sound parametric assumptions have been developped to enable extrapolation beyond the range of the observations. More precisely, we build on the PoT method that was developped in hydrology where PoT stands for  "Peaks-over-Threshold". The observations exceeding a given threshold are modeled by the generalized {Pareto} distribution. This distribution can approximate arbitrarily well the tail of most distributions. We build a new distribution, the hybrid {Pareto}, by stitching together a truncated Normal and a generalized {Pareto} distribution. We impose continuity constraints at the junction point. The hybrid {Pareto} is thus a smooth distribution that can be used in a mixture model.  The behavior of the upper tail of the hybrid is similar to the behavior of the generalized {Pareto} tail. Moreover, the threshold inherent in the the PoT methodology can now be defined implicitly as the junction point of the component with the heaviest tail. This component also determines the tail index of the mixture. Hence, the hybrid {Pareto} mixture offers an alternate way to estimate the tail index associated with heavy-tailed data. In several applications, information that has predictive power on the variable of interest is available. In that case, we want to model the conditional density of Y given X, the vector containing predictive information. When the distribution of Y given X is asymmetric, multi-modal and heavy-tailed, we propose to use a mixure of hybrid {Pareto}s whose parameters are functions of X. Those functions are implemented by means of a neural network with one hidden layer. Neural neworks are non-parametric models that can, in principle, approximate any continuous function.  Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that the hybrid {Pareto} mixture, unconditional and conditional, outperforms other density estimators in terms of log-likelihood.}

All these methods require unlabeled data over which to compare functions and detect gross differences in behavior away from the training points. We introduce three new extensions of the metric model selection methods and apply them to feature selection. The first extension takes advantage of the particular case of time-series data in which the task involves prediction with a horizon h. The idea is to use at t the h unlabeled examples that precede t for model selection. The second extension takes advantage of the different error distributions of cross-validation and the metric methods: cross-validation tends to have a larger variance and is unbiased. A hybrid combining the two model selection methods is rarely beaten by any of the two methods. The third extension deals with the case when unlabeled data is not available at all, using an estimated input density. Experiments are described to study these extensions in the context of capacity control and feature subset selection.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques.
Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to monimize an overall peformance measure.
Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks.
A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with a global training technique to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

collaborative filtering. We show their performance on compound prioritization for an HTS campaign and
the underlying shared representation between targets. JRank outperformed the neural network both in the

First, it extends them to function induction algorithms that minimize a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happen to have the form of Parzen windows regressors. This allows to predict test labels without solving again a linear system of dimension n (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Second, this function induction procedure gives rise to an efficient approximation of the training process, reducing the linear system to be solved to m << n unknowns, using only a subset of m examples. An improvement of O(n^2/m^2) in time can thus be obtained. Comparative experiments are presented, showing the good performance of the induction formula and approximation algorithm.},

     abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) have had great success in machine learning tasks involving vision and represent one of the early successes of deep networks. Local receptive fields and weight
sharing make their architecture ideally suited for vision tasks by helping to enforce a prior based on our knowledge of natural images. This same prior could also be applied to recent developments in the field of deep networks, in order to tailor these new architectures for artificial vision. In this context, we show how the Restricted {Boltzmann} Machine (RBM), the building block of Deep Belief Networks (DBN), can be adapted to operate in a convolutional manner. We compare their performance to standard fully-connected RBMs on a simple visual learning task and show that the convolutional RBMs (CRBMs) converge to smaller values of the negative likelihood function. Our experiments also indicate that CRBMs are more efficient than standard RBMs trained on small image patches, with the CRBMs having faster convergence.}

However, we find that it often does a very poor job of rendering the diversity of modes captured by the trained model. We suspect that this hinders the advantage that could in principle be brought by training algorithms relying on Gibbs sampling for uncovering spurious modes, such as the Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we
explore the use of tempered {Markov} Chain Monte-Carlo for sampling in RBMs. We find both through visualization of samples and measures of likelihood that it helps both sampling and learning.}

This study was the most exhaustive ever undertaken by this particular insurer and lasted over an entire year. We analyzed the discriminating power of each variable used for ratemaking. We analyzed the performance of several models within five broad categories: linear regressions, generalized linear models, decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. In this paper, we present the main results of this study. We qualitatively compare models and show how neural networks can represent high-order nonlinear dependencies with a small number of parameters, each of which is estimated on a large proportion of the data, thus yielding low variance. We thoroughly explain the purpose of the nonlinear sigmoidal transforms which are at the very heart of neural networks' performances. The main numerical result is a statistically significant reduction in the out-of-sample mean-squared error using the neural network model and our ability to substantially reduce the median premium by charging more to the highest risks. This in turn can translate into substantial savings and financial benefits for an insurer. We hope this paper goes a long way towards convincing actuaries to include neural networks within their set of modeling tools for ratemaking.},

Here we consider the problem of extracting essential ingredients of music signals, such as well-defined global temporal structure in the form of nested periodicities (or {\em meter}). Can we construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style? Because recurrent neural networks can in principle learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that {RNN}s cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure.

After training on a series of noise-free signals, a network is shown to only synchronize with signals having little or no noise.

  abstract = {This dissertation uses a network of relaxation oscillators to beat along with temporal signals. Relaxation oscillators exhibit interspersed slow-fast movement and model a wide array of biological oscillations. The model is built up gradually: first a single relaxation oscillator is exposed to rhythms and shown to be good at finding downbeats in them. Then large networks of oscillators are mutually coupled in an exploration of their internal synchronization behavior. It is demonstrated that appropriate weights on coupling connections cause a network to form multiple pools of oscillators having stable phase relationships. This is a promising first step towards networks that can recreate a rhythmical pattern from memory. In the full model, a coupled network of relaxation oscillators is exposed to rhythmical patterns. It is shown that the network finds downbeats in patterns while continuing to exhibit good internal stability. A novel non-dynamical model of downbeat induction called the Normalized Positive (NP) clock model is proposed, analyzed, and used to generate comparison predictions for the oscillator model. The oscillator model compares favorably to other dynamical approaches to beat induction such as adaptive oscillators. However, the relaxation oscillator model takes advantage of intrinsic synchronization stability to allow the creation of large coupled networks. This research lays the groundwork for a long-term research goal, a robotic arm that responds to rhythmical signals by tapping along. It also opens the door to future work in connectionist learning of long rhythmical patterns.},

   abstract = {One major challenge in using statistical sequence learning methods in the domain of music lies in bridging the long timelags that separate important musical events. Consider, for example, the chord changes that convey the basic structure of a pop song. A sequence learner that cannot predict chord changes will almost certainly not be able to generate new examples in a musical style or to categorize songs by style. Yet, it is surprisingly difficult for a sequence learner to bridge the long timelags necessary to identify when a chord change will occur and what its new value will be. This is the case because chord changes can be separated by dozens or hundreds of intervening notes. One could solve this problem by treating chords as being special (as did Mozer, NIPS 1991). But this is impractical---it requires chords to be labeled specially in the dataset, limiting the applicability of the model to non-labeled examples---and furthermore does not address the general issue of nested temporal structure in music. I will briefly describe this temporal structure (known commonly as "meter") and present a model that uses to its advantage an assumption that sequences are metrical. The model consists of an autocorrelation-based filtration that estimates online the most likely metrical tree (i.e. the frequency and phase of beat, measure, phrase &etc.) and uses that to generate a series of sequences varying at different rates. These sequences correspond to each level in the hierarchy. Multiple learners can be used to treat each series separately and their predictions can be combined to perform composition and categorization. I will present preliminary results that demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. Time permitting I will also compare the model to alternate approaches.},

     abstract = {A number of biological and mechanical processes are typified by a continued slow accrual and fast release of energy. A nonlinear oscillator exhibiting this slow-fast behavior is called a relaxation oscillator and is used to model, for example, human heartbeat pacemaking and neural action potential. Similar limit cycle oscillators are used to model a wider range of behaviors including predator-prey relationships and synchrony in animal populations such as fireflies. Though nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators have been successfully applied to beat induction, relaxation oscillators have received less attention. In this work we offer a novel and effective relaxation oscillator model of beat induction. We outline the model in detail and provide a perturbation analysis of its response to external stimuli. In a series of simulations we expose the model to patterns from Experiment 1 of Povel \& Essens (1985). We then examine the beat assignments of the model. Although the overall performance of the model is very good, there are shortcomings. We believe that a network of mutually-coupled oscillators will address many of these shortcomings, and we suggest an appropriate course for future research.\\ {\em Note: See the 2001 {\em Psychological Research} article "Finding Downbeats with a Relaxation Oscillator" for a revised but less detailed version of this paper.}},

In this paper we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for {HMM}s and {IOHMM}s.},

Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

labeled and unlabeled data. This task can be undertaken by discriminative methods,
provided that learning criteria are adapted consequently. In this chapter, we motivate the use of entropy regularization as a means to benefit from unlabeled data in
the framework of maximum a posteriori estimation. The learning criterion is derived
from clearly stated assumptions and can be applied to any smoothly parametrized
model of posterior probabilities. The regularization scheme favors low density separation, without any modeling of the density of input features. The contribution
of unlabeled data to the learning criterion induces local optima, but this problem
can be alleviated by deterministic annealing. For well-behaved models of posterior
probabilities, deterministic annealing {EM} provides a decomposition of the learning
problem in a series of concave subproblems. Other approaches to the semi-supervised
problem are shown to be close relatives or limiting cases of entropy regularization.
A series of experiments illustrates the good behavior of the algorithm in terms of
performance and robustness with respect to the violation of the postulated low density separation assumption. The minimum entropy solution benefits from unlabeled
data and is able to challenge mixture models and manifold learning in a number of
situations.},

In this paper we demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) is an {RNN} capable of robustly categorizing timewarped speech data, thus combining the most useful features of both paradigms. We compare its performance to {SNN}s on two variants of a spoken digit identification task, using data from an international competition. The first task (described in Nature (Nadis 2003)) required the categorisation of spoken digits with only a single training exemplar, and was specifically designed to test robustness to timewarping. Here {LSTM} performed better than all the {SNN}s in the competition. The second task was to predict spoken digits using a larger training set. Here {LSTM} greatly outperformed an {SNN}-like model found in the literature. These results suggest that {LSTM} has a place in domains that require the learning of large timewarped datasets, such as automatic speech recognition.},

The goal is to be able to identify which categories of instrument (Strings, Woodwind, Guitar, Piano, etc.) are present in a given audio example. We use a machine learning approach to solve this task. We constructed a system to generate a large database of musically relevant poly-instrument audio. Our database is generated from hundreds of instruments classiﬁed in 7 categories. Musical audio examples are generated by mixing multi-track MIDI ﬁles with thousands of instrument combinations. We compare three different classiﬁers : a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}), a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Deep Belief Network (DBN). We show that the DBN tends to outperform both the {SVM} and the MLP in most cases.}

In this paper we present a methodology to optimize several hyper-parameters, based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters. In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters is efficiently computed by back-propagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion.},

this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for
RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This
approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.}

  abstract = {Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted {Boltzmann} machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.}

  abstract = {Le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle a pour objectif le d{\'{e}}veloppement de syst{\`{e}}mes informatiques capables de simuler des comportements normalement associ{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} l'intelligence humaine. On aimerait entre autres pouvoir construire une machine qui puisse
r{\'{e}}soudre des t{\^{a}}ches li{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} la vision (e.g., la reconnaissance d'objet), au traitement de la langue (e.g., l'identification du sujet d'un texte) ou au traitement de signaux sonores (e.g., la reconnaissance de la parole).
     Une approche d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}e afin de r{\'{e}}soudre ce genre de t{\^{a}}ches est bas{\'{e}}e sur l'apprentissage automatique de mod{\`{e}}les {\`{a}} partir de donn{\'{e}}es {\'{e}}tiquet{\'{e}}es refl{\'{e}}tant le comportement intelligent {\`{a}} {\'{e}}muler. Entre autre, il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} propos{\'{e}} de mod{\'{e}}liser le calcul n{\'{e}}cessaire {\`{a}} la
r{\'{e}}solution d'une t{\^{a}}che {\`{a}} l'aide d'un r{\'{e}}seau de neurones artificiel, dont il est possible d'adapter le comportement {\`{a}} l'aide de la r{\'{e}}tropropagation [99, 131] d'un gradient informatif sur les erreurs commises par le r{\'{e}}seau. Populaire durant les ann{\'{e}}es 80, cette
approche sp{\'{e}}cifique a depuis perdu partiellement de son attrait, suite au d{\'{e}}veloppement des m{\'{e}}thodes {\`{a}} noyau. Celles-ci sont souvent plus stables, plus faciles {\`{a}} utiliser et leur performance est souvent au moins aussi {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}e pour une vaste gamme de probl{\`{e}}mes.
     Les m{\'{e}}thodes d'apprentissage automatique ont donc progress{\'{e}} dans leur fonctionnement, mais aussi dans la complexit{\'{e}} des probl{\`{e}}mes auxquels elles se sont attaqu{\'{e}}. Ainsi, plus r{\'{e}}cemment, des travaux [12, 15] ont commenc{\'{e}} {\`{a}} {\'{e}}mettre des doutes sur la capacit{\'{e}} des machines {\`{a}} noyau {\`{a}} pouvoir efficacement r{\'{e}}soudre des probl{\`{e}}mes de la complexit{\'{e}} requise par l'intelligence artificielle. Parall{\`{e}}lement, Hinton et al. [81] faisaient une perc{\'{e}}e dans l'apprentissage automatique de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones, en proposant une proc{\'{e}}dure permettant l'entra{\^{\i}}nement de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones d'une plus grande complexit{\'{e}} (i.e., avec plus de couches de neurones cach{\'{e}}es) qu'il n'{\'{e}}tait possible auparavant.
     C'est dans ce contexte qu'ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} conduits les travaux de cette th{\`{e}}se. Cette th{\`{e}}se d{\'{e}}bute par une exposition des principes de base de l'apprentissage automatique (chapitre 1) et une discussion des obstacles {\`{a}} l'obtention d'un mod{\`{e}}le ayant une bonne performance
de g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisation (chapitre 2). Puis, sont pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}es les contributions apport{\'{e}}es dans le cadre de cinq articles, contributions qui sont toutes bas{\'{e}}es sur l'utilisation d'une certaine
forme d'apprentissage non-supervis{\'{e}}.
    Le premier article (chapitre 4) propose une m{\'{e}}thode d'entra{\^{\i}}nement pour un type sp{\'{e}}cifique de r{\'{e}}seau {\`{a}} une seule couche cach{\'{e}}e (la machine de {Boltzmann} restreinte) bas{\'{e}}e sur une combinaison des apprentissages supervis{\'{e}} et non-supervis{\'{e}}. Cette m{\'{e}}thode permet d'obtenir une meilleure performance de g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisation qu'un r{\'{e}}seau de neurones standard ou qu'une machine {\`{a}} vecteurs de support {\`{a}} noyau, et met en {\'{e}}vidence de fa{\c c}on

for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In
this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for
RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This
approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.}

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. 
Real-life document recognition systems are composed or multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. 
Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. 
A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

Under mild assumptions, we also find better error bounds than with ordinary neural networks. Furthermore, this parametrization may help reducing the problem of saturation of the neurons. In a second approach, the input-to-hidden weights arefully non-parametric, yielding a kernel machine for which we demonstrate a simple kernel formula.

Bien qu'ils aient {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} {\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}}s pour la premi{\`{e}}re fois il y a cinquante ans par Rosenblatt [68], ils ne furent r{\'{e}}ellement populaires qu'apr{\`{e}}s l'apparition de la r{\'{e}}tropropagation du gradient, en 1986 [71].
En 1989, il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} prouv{\'{e}} [44] qu'une classe sp{\'{e}}cifique de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones (les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e) {\'{e}}tait suffisamment puissante pour pouvoir approximer presque n'importe quelle fonction avec une pr{\'{e}}cision arbitraire : le th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me d'approximation universelle. Toutefois, bien que ce th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me e{\^{u}}t pour cons{\'{e}}quence un int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t accru pour les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones, il semblerait qu'aucun effort n'ait {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} fait pour profiter de cette propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}.
En outre, l'optimisation des r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e n'est pas convexe. Cela a d{\'{e}}tourn{\'{e}} une grande partie de la communaut{\'{e}} vers d'autres algorithmes, comme par exemple les machines {\`{a}} noyau (machines {\`{a}} vecteurs de support et r{\'{e}}gression
{\`{a}} noyau, entre autres).
La premi{\`{e}}re partie de cette th{\`{e}}se pr{\'{e}}sentera les concepts d'apprentissage machine g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}raux n{\'{e}}cessaires {\`{a}} la compr{\'{e}}hension des algorithmes utilis{\'{e}}s.

La quatri{\`{e}}me partie pr{\'{e}}sente une technique permettant d'optimiser les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e de mani{\`{e}}re convexe. Bien que cette technique s'av{\`{e}}re difficilement exploitable pour des probl{\`{e}}mes de grande taille, une version approch{\'{e}}e permet d'obtenir une bonne solution dans un temps raisonnable.
La cinqui{\`{e}}me partie se concentre sur les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e infinie. Cela leur permet th{\'{e}}oriquement d'exploiter la propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d'approximation universelle et ainsi d'approcher facilement une plus grande classe de fonctions.
Toutefois, si ces deux variations sur les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e leur conf{\`{e}}rent des propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s int{\'{e}}ressantes, ces derniers ne peuvent extraire plus que des concepts de bas niveau.

ces deux types d'algorithmes ne peut appr{\'{e}}hender des probl{\`{e}}mes faisant appel {\`{a}} l'apprentissage de concepts de haut niveau.
R{\'{e}}cemment sont apparus les Deep Belief Networks [39] qui sont des r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} plusieurs couches cach{\'{e}}es entra{\^{\i}}n{\'{e}}s de mani{\`{e}}re efficace.

Les probl{\`{e}}mes que l'on rencontre actuellement n{\'{e}}cessitent non seulement des algorithmes capables d'extraire des concepts de haut niveau, mais {\'{e}}galement des m{\'{e}}thodes d'optimisation capables de traiter l'immense quantit{\'{e}} de donn{\'{e}}es parfois disponibles, si possible en temps r{\'{e}}el.

     abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made or words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of much longer contexts.},

Yet little work with music streams has been conducted and these features remain mostly unused in the MIR community. In this paper we further explore the use of these features for musical signals. In particular, we investigate their use on realistic music examples (i.e. released commercial music) and their use as input features for supervised learning.

A database of AT&T employees (the visitors' hosts) and country names is used to check the recognition module outputs, in order to find the best match. The system provides assistance to the guard at one of the guard stations in routing visitors to their hosts. All the entered data are stored electronically. Initial testing shows that PENGUIN system performs reliably and with high accuracy. It retrieves the correct host name with 97\% accuracy and the correct visitors citizenship with 99\% accuracy. The system is robust and easy to use for both visitors and guards},

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.},

Such tests should take into account the variability due to the choice of training set and not only that due to the test examples, as is often the case. This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased. This analysis allows us to propose new estimators of this variance. We show, via simulations, that tests of hypothesis about the generalization error using those new variance estimators have better properties than tests involving variance estimators currently in use and listed in (Dietterich, 1998). In particular, the new tests have correct size and good power.

to the variability of the target. Our discussion covers supervised, semisupervised

found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function
at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This
makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for
classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the
Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations,
these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to
the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist
short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity
may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning
algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured
but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations),
while not using very specific prior domain knowledge.},

The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the cluster assumption.

For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a fixed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that
has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model.},

The training criterion used in {SVM}s is not appropriate for this purpose so we adopt the simple criterion that is generally used when training neural networks for classification tasks.

In the case of kernel {PCA} or spectral clustering this reduces computation to O(m^2 n). For the same computational complexity, we can also compute the feature space projection of the non-selected examples on the subspace spanned by the selected examples, to estimate the embedding function based on all the data, which yields considerably better estimation of the embedding function. This algorithm can be formulated in an online setting and we can bound the error on the approximation of the Gram matrix.},

While this is true for some data, it is clearly not true for some other. We present here a modification of the M algorithm that allows negative updates. Negative updates are used to maintain a window over the source. Symbols enter the window at its right and will leave it at its left, after w steps (the window width).

  abstract = {Dopaminergic neuron activity has been modeled during learning and appetitive behavior, most commonly using the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. However, a proper representation of elapsed time and of the exact task is usually required for the model to work. Most models use timing elements such as delay-line representations of time that are not biologically realistic for intervals in the range of seconds. The interval-timing literature provides several alternatives. One of them is that timing could emerge from general network dynamics, instead of coming from a dedicated circuit. Here, we present a general rate-based learning model based on long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks that learns a time representation when needed. Using a na{\"{\i}}ve network learning its environment in conjunction with TD, we reproduce dopamine activity in appetitive trace conditioning with a constant CS-US interval, including probe trials with unexpected delays. The proposed model learns a representation of the environment dynamics in an adaptive biologically plausible framework, without recourse to delay lines or other special-purpose circuits. Instead, the model predicts that the task-dependent representation of time is learned by experience, is encoded in ramp-like changes in single-neuron activity distributed across small neural networks, and reflects a temporal integration mechanism resulting from the inherent dynamics of recurrent loops within the network. The model also reproduces the known finding that trace conditioning is more difficult than delay conditioning and that the learned representation of the task can be highly dependent on the types of trials experienced during training. Finally, it suggests that the phasic dopaminergic signal could facilitate learning in the cortex.}

  abstract = {Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of learning algorithms. A recently proposed boosting algorithm is AdaBoost. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using mainly decision trees as base classifiers. In this paper we investigate whether AdaBoost also works as well with neural networks, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of di_erent versions of the AdaBoost algorithm. In particular, we compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. The results suggest that random resampling of the training data is not the main explanation of the success of the improvements brought by AdaBoost. This is in contrast to Bagging which directly aims at reducing variance and for which random resampling is essential to obtain the reduction in generalization error. Our system achieves about 1.4\% error on a data set of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. A boosted multi-layer network achieved 1.5\% error on the UCI Letters and 8.1\% error on the UCI satellite data set, which is significantly better than boosted decision trees.},

Open source tools have recently reached a level of maturity which makes them suitable for building large-scale real-world systems. At the same time, the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning and the general scientific community.}

  abstract = {Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of "Web 2.0" recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the cold-start problem common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and
recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable  baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data.}

  abstract = {While both dopamine (DA) ﬂuctuations and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) are known to inﬂuence long-term corticostriatal plasticity, little attention has been devoted to the interaction between these two fundamental mechanisms. Here, a theoretical framework is proposed to account for experimental results specifying the role of presynaptic activation, postsynaptic activation, and concentrations of extracellular DA in synaptic plasticity. Our starting point was an explicitly-implemented multiplicative rule linking STDP to Michaelis-Menton equations that models the dynamics of extracellular DA ﬂuctuations. This rule captures a wide range of results on conditions leading to long-term potentiation and depression in simulations that manipulate the frequency of induced corticostriatal stimulation and DA release. A well-documented biphasic function relating DA concentrations to synaptic plasticity emerges naturally from simulations involving a multiplicative rule linking DA and neural activity. This biphasic function is found consistently across different neural coding schemes employed (voltage-based vs. spike-based models). By comparison, an additive rule fails to capture these results. The proposed framework is the ﬁrst to generate testable predictions on the dual inﬂuence of DA concentrations and STDP on long-term plasticity, suggesting a way in which the biphasic inﬂuence of DA concentrations can modulate the direction and magnitude of change induced by STDP, and raising the possibility that DA concentrations may inverse the LTP/LTD components of the STDP rule.}

It is based on mixtures of specialized neural networks, in order to reduce the effect of outliers on the estimation.

The extended methods (xTRI, xADJ, xADA) use a model of the input density directly estimated from the training set. The intuition is that the main reason why the above methods work well is that they make sure that the learned function behaves similarly on the training points and on neighboring points. The experiments are based on estimating a simple non-parametric density model. They show that the extended methods perform comparably to the originals even though no unlabeled data is used.},

This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make na{\"{\i}}ve estimators (that dont take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.},

It extends them to function induction algorithms that correspond to the minimization of a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happens to have the form of a Parzen windows regressor. The advantage of the extension is that it allows predicting the label for a new example without having to solve again a linear system of dimension n (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Experiments show that the extension works well, in the sense of predicting a label close to the one that would have been obtained if the test example had been included in the unlabeled set. This relatively efficient function induction procedure can also be used when n is large to approximate the solution by writing it only in terms of a kernel expansion with m << n terms, and reducing the linear system to m equations in m unknowns.},

This analysis suggests non-local manifold learning algorithms which attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A criterion for such an algorithm is proposed and experiments estimating a tangent plane prediction function are presented. The function has parameters that are shared across space rather than estimated based on the local neighborhood, as in current non-parametric manifold learning algorithms. The results show clearly the advantages of this approach with respect to local manifold learning algorithms.},

ways. In the first approach proposed, a finite parametrization is possible, allowing gradient-based
learning. While having the same number of parameters as an ordinary neural network, its internal
structure suggests that it can represent some smooth functions much more compactly. Under mild
assumptions, we also find better error bounds than with ordinary neural networks. Furthermore, this
parametrization may help reducing the problem of saturation of the neurons. In a second approach, the
input-to-hidden weights are fully non-parametric, yielding a kernel machine for which we demonstrate
a simple kernel formula. Interestingly, the resulting kernel machine can be made hyperparameter-free
and still generalizes in spite of an absence of explicit regularization.},

similar expressions however entail almost identical empirical behaviors.
Then, we look for a conservative test for detecting significant differences

derivation of the form of a t-statistic parametrized by the correlation of
residuals between each validation set. Its calibration is compared to the
usual t-test. While the latter is overconfident in concluding that differences are indeed significant, our test is bound to be more skeptical, with

We propose a new non-parametric kernel density estimation method which captures the local structure of an underlying manifold through the leading eigenvectors of regularized local covariance matrices. Experiments in density estimation show significant improvements with respect to Parzen density estimators. The density estimators can also be used within Bayes classifiers, yielding classification rates similar to {SVM}s and much superior to the Parzen classifier.},

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.}

this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for
RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This
approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.}

To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques.
